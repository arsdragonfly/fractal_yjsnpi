# fractal-yjsnpi

This is a tool that lets you create fractal images of YJSNPI (or anyone you like).

ikisugi.png is the original image file; be sure to leave unwanted areas of your image transparent before replacing it with your own, so that Senpais will correctly overlap each other.

This tool requires Python 2.7+ and PIL library (the Pillow fork).
